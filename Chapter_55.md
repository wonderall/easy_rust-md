## Default and the builder pattern

You can implement the `Default` trait to give values to a `struct` or `enum` that you think will be most common. The builder pattern works nicely with this to let users easily make changes when they want. First let's look at `Default`. Actually, most general types in Rust already have `Default`. They are not surprising: 0, "" (empty strings), `false`, etc.

```rust
fn main() {
    let default_i8: i8 = Default::default();
    let default_str: String = Default::default();
    let default_bool: bool = Default::default();

    println!("'{}', '{}', '{}'", default_i8, default_str, default_bool);
}
```

This prints `'0', '', 'false'`.

So `Default` is like the `new` function except you don't have to enter anything. First we will make a `struct` that doesn't implement `Default` yet. It has a `new` function which we use to make a character named Billy with some stats.

```rust
struct Character {
    name: String,
    age: u8,
    height: u32,
    weight: u32,
    lifestate: LifeState,
}

enum LifeState {
    Alive,
    Dead,
    NeverAlive,
    Uncertain
}

impl Character {
    fn new(name: String, age: u8, height: u32, weight: u32, alive: bool) -> Self {
        Self {
            name,
            age,
            height,
            weight,
            lifestate: if alive { LifeState::Alive } else { LifeState::Dead },
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let character_1 = Character::new("Billy".to_string(), 15, 170, 70, true);
}
```

But maybe in our world we want most of the characters to be named Billy, age 15, height 170, weight 70, and alive. We can implement `Default` so that we can just write `Character::default()`. It looks like this:

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Character {
    name: String,
    age: u8,
    height: u32,
    weight: u32,
    lifestate: LifeState,
}

#[derive(Debug)]
enum LifeState {
    Alive,
    Dead,
    NeverAlive,
    Uncertain,
}

impl Character {
    fn new(name: String, age: u8, height: u32, weight: u32, alive: bool) -> Self {
        Self {
            name,
            age,
            height,
            weight,
            lifestate: if alive {
                LifeState::Alive
            } else {
                LifeState::Dead
            },
        }
    }
}

impl Default for Character {
    fn default() -> Self {
        Self {
            name: "Billy".to_string(),
            age: 15,
            height: 170,
            weight: 70,
            lifestate: LifeState::Alive,
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let character_1 = Character::default();

    println!(
        "The character {:?} is {:?} years old.",
        character_1.name, character_1.age
    );
}
```

It prints `The character "Billy" is 15 years old.` Much easier!

Now comes the builder pattern. We will have many Billys, so we will keep the default. But a lot of other characters will be only a bit different. The builder pattern lets us chain very small methods to change one value each time. Here is one such method for `Character`:

```rust
fn height(mut self, height: u32) -> Self {    // ğŸš§
    self.height = height;
    self
}
```

Make sure to notice that it takes a `mut self`. We saw this once before, and it is not a mutable reference (`&mut self`). It takes ownership of `Self` and with `mut` it will be mutable, even if it wasn't mutable before. That's because `.height()` has full ownership and nobody else can touch it, so it is safe to be mutable. Then it just changes `self.height` and returns `Self` (which is `Character`).

So let's have three of these builder methods. They are almost the same:

```rust
fn height(mut self, height: u32) -> Self {     // ğŸš§
    self.height = height;
    self
}

fn weight(mut self, weight: u32) -> Self {
    self.weight = weight;
    self
}

fn name(mut self, name: &str) -> Self {
    self.name = name.to_string();
    self
}
```

Each one of those changes one variable and gives `Self` back: this is what you see in the builder pattern. So now we can write something like this to make a character: `let character_1 = Character::default().height(180).weight(60).name("Bobby");`. If you are building a library for someone else to use, this can make it easy for them. It's easy for the end user because it almost looks like natural English: "Give me a default character but with height of 180, weight of 60, and name of Bobby." So far our code looks like this:

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Character {
    name: String,
    age: u8,
    height: u32,
    weight: u32,
    lifestate: LifeState,
}

#[derive(Debug)]
enum LifeState {
    Alive,
    Dead,
    NeverAlive,
    Uncertain,
}

impl Character {
    fn new(name: String, age: u8, height: u32, weight: u32, alive: bool) -> Self {
        Self {
            name,
            age,
            height,
            weight,
            lifestate: if alive {
                LifeState::Alive
            } else {
                LifeState::Dead
            },
        }
    }

    fn height(mut self, height: u32) -> Self {
        self.height = height;
        self
    }

    fn weight(mut self, weight: u32) -> Self {
        self.weight = weight;
        self
    }

    fn name(mut self, name: &str) -> Self {
        self.name = name.to_string();
        self
    }
}

impl Default for Character {
    fn default() -> Self {
        Self {
            name: "Billy".to_string(),
            age: 15,
            height: 170,
            weight: 70,
            lifestate: LifeState::Alive,
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let character_1 = Character::default().height(180).weight(60).name("Bobby");

    println!("{:?}", character_1);
}
```

One last method to add is usually called `.build()`. This method is a sort of final check. When you give a user a method like `.height()` you can make sure that they only put in a `u32()`, but what if they enter 5000 for height? That might not be okay in the game you are making. We will use a final method called `.build()` that returns a `Result`. Inside it we will check if the user input is okay, and if it is, we will return an `Ok(Self)`.

First though let's change the `.new()` method. We don't want users to be free to create any kind of character anymore. So we'll move the values from `impl Default` to `.new()`. And now `.new()` doesn't take any input.

```rust
    fn new() -> Self {    // ğŸš§
        Self {
            name: "Billy".to_string(),
            age: 15,
            height: 170,
            weight: 70,
            lifestate: LifeState::Alive,
        }
    }
```

That means we don't need `impl Default` anymore, because `.new()` has all the default values. So we can delete `impl Default`.

Now our code looks like this:

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Character {
    name: String,
    age: u8,
    height: u32,
    weight: u32,
    lifestate: LifeState,
}

#[derive(Debug)]
enum LifeState {
    Alive,
    Dead,
    NeverAlive,
    Uncertain,
}

impl Character {
    fn new() -> Self {
        Self {
            name: "Billy".to_string(),
            age: 15,
            height: 170,
            weight: 70,
            lifestate: LifeState::Alive,
        }
    }

    fn height(mut self, height: u32) -> Self {
        self.height = height;
        self
    }

    fn weight(mut self, weight: u32) -> Self {
        self.weight = weight;
        self
    }

    fn name(mut self, name: &str) -> Self {
        self.name = name.to_string();
        self
    }
}

fn main() {
    let character_1 = Character::new().height(180).weight(60).name("Bobby");

    println!("{:?}", character_1);
}
```

This prints the same thing: `Character { name: "Bobby", age: 15, height: 180, weight: 60, lifestate: Alive }`.

We are almost ready to write the method `.build()`, but there is one problem: how do we make the user use it? Right now a user can write `let x = Character::new().height(76767);` and get a `Character`. There are many ways to do this, and maybe you can imagine your own. But we will add a `can_use: bool` value to `Character`.

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]       // ğŸš§
struct Character {
    name: String,
    age: u8,
    height: u32,
    weight: u32,
    lifestate: LifeState,
    can_use: bool, // Set whether the user can use the character
}

\\ Cut other code

    fn new() -> Self {
        Self {
            name: "Billy".to_string(),
            age: 15,
            height: 170,
            weight: 70,
            lifestate: LifeState::Alive,
            can_use: true, // .new() always gives a good character, so it's true
        }
    }
```

And for the other methods like `.height()`, we will set `can_use` to `false`. Only `.build()` will set it to `true` again, so now the user has to do a final check with `.build()`. We will make sure that `height` is not above 200 and `weight` is not above 300. Also, in our game there is a bad word called `smurf` that we don't want characters to use.

Our `.build()` method looks like this:

```rust
fn build(mut self) -> Result<Character, String> {      // ğŸš§
    if self.height < 200 && self.weight < 300 && !self.name.to_lowercase().contains("smurf") {
        self.can_use = true;
        Ok(self)
    } else {
        Err("Could not create character. Characters must have:
1) Height below 200
2) Weight below 300
3) A name that is not Smurf (that is a bad word)"
            .to_string())
    }
}
```

`!self.name.to_lowercase().contains("smurf")` makes sure that the user doesn't write something like "SMURF" or "IamSmurf" . It makes the whole `String` lowercase (small letters), and checks for `.contains()` instead of `==`. And the `!` in front means "not".

If everything is okay, we set `can_use` to `true`, and give the character to the user inside `Ok`.

Now that our code is done, we will create three characters that don't work, and one character that does work. The final code looks like this:

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Character {
    name: String,
    age: u8,
    height: u32,
    weight: u32,
    lifestate: LifeState,
    can_use: bool, // Here is the new value
}

#[derive(Debug)]
enum LifeState {
    Alive,
    Dead,
    NeverAlive,
    Uncertain,
}

impl Character {
    fn new() -> Self {
        Self {
            name: "Billy".to_string(),
            age: 15,
            height: 170,
            weight: 70,
            lifestate: LifeState::Alive,
            can_use: true,  // .new() makes a fine character, so it is true
        }
    }

    fn height(mut self, height: u32) -> Self {
        self.height = height;
        self.can_use = false; // Now the user can't use the character
        self
    }

    fn weight(mut self, weight: u32) -> Self {
        self.weight = weight;
        self.can_use = false;
        self
    }

    fn name(mut self, name: &str) -> Self {
        self.name = name.to_string();
        self.can_use = false;
        self
    }

    fn build(mut self) -> Result<Character, String> {
        if self.height < 200 && self.weight < 300 && !self.name.to_lowercase().contains("smurf") {
            self.can_use = true;   // Everything is okay, so set to true
            Ok(self)               // and return the character
        } else {
            Err("Could not create character. Characters must have:
1) Height below 200
2) Weight below 300
3) A name that is not Smurf (that is a bad word)"
                .to_string())
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let character_with_smurf = Character::new().name("Lol I am Smurf!!").build(); // This one contains "smurf" - not okay
    let character_too_tall = Character::new().height(400).build(); // Too tall - not okay
    let character_too_heavy = Character::new().weight(500).build(); // Too heavy - not okay
    let okay_character = Character::new()
        .name("Billybrobby")
        .height(180)
        .weight(100)
        .build();   // This character is okay. Name is fine, height and weight are fine

    // Now they are not Character, they are Result<Character, String>. So let's put them in a Vec so we can see them:
    let character_vec = vec![character_with_smurf, character_too_tall, character_too_heavy, okay_character];

    for character in character_vec { // Now we will print the character if it's Ok, and print the error if it's Err
        match character {
            Ok(character_info) => println!("{:?}", character_info),
            Err(err_info) => println!("{}", err_info),
        }
        println!(); // Then add one more line
    }
}
```

This will print:

```text
Could not create character. Characters must have:
1) Height below 200
2) Weight below 300
3) A name that is not Smurf (that is a bad word)

Could not create character. Characters must have:
1) Height below 200
2) Weight below 300
3) A name that is not Smurf (that is a bad word)

Could not create character. Characters must have:
1) Height below 200
2) Weight below 300
3) A name that is not Smurf (that is a bad word)

Character { name: "Billybrobby", age: 15, height: 180, weight: 100, lifestate: Alive, can_use: true }
```
