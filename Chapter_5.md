## ЁЯЪз and тЪая╕П

Sometimes the code examples in the book don't work. If an example doesn't work, it will have a ЁЯЪз or a тЪая╕П in it. ЁЯЪз is like "under construction": it means that the code is not complete. Rust needs a `fn main()` (a main function) to run, but sometimes we just want to look at small pieces of code so it won't have a `fn main()`. Those examples are correct, but need a `fn main()` for you to run them. And some code examples show you a problem that we will fix. Those ones might have a `fn main()` but generate an error, and so they will have a тЪая╕П.
