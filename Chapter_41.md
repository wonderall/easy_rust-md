## Interior mutability

### Cell

**Interior mutability** means having a little bit of mutability on the inside. Remember how in Rust you need to use `mut` to change a variable? There are also some ways to change them without the word `mut`. This is because Rust has some ways to let you safely change values inside of a struct that is immutable. Each one of them follows some rules that make sure that changing the values is still safe.

First, let's look at a simple example where we would want this. Imagine a `struct` called `PhoneModel` with many fields:

```rust
struct PhoneModel {
    company_name: String,
    model_name: String,
    screen_size: f32,
    memory: usize,
    date_issued: u32,
    on_sale: bool,
}

fn main() {
    let super_phone_3000 = PhoneModel {
        company_name: "YY Electronics".to_string(),
        model_name: "Super Phone 3000".to_string(),
        screen_size: 7.5,
        memory: 4_000_000,
        date_issued: 2020,
        on_sale: true,
    };

}
```

It is better for the fields in `PhoneModel` to be immutable, because we don't want the data to change. The `date_issued` and `screen_size` never change, for example.

But inside is one field called `on_sale`. A phone model will first be on sale (`true`), but later the company will stop selling it. Can we make just this one field mutable? Because we don't want to write `let mut super_phone_3000`. If we do, then every field will become mutable.

Rust has many ways to allow some safe mutability inside of something that is immutable. The most simple way is called `Cell`. First we use `use std::cell::Cell` so that we can just write `Cell` instead of `std::cell::Cell` every time.

Then we change `on_sale: bool` to `on_sale: Cell<bool>`. Now it isn't a bool: it's a `Cell` that holds a `bool`.

`Cell` has a method called `.set()` where you can change the value. We use `.set()` to change `on_sale: true` to `on_sale: Cell::new(true)`.

```rust
use std::cell::Cell;

struct PhoneModel {
    company_name: String,
    model_name: String,
    screen_size: f32,
    memory: usize,
    date_issued: u32,
    on_sale: Cell<bool>,
}

fn main() {
    let super_phone_3000 = PhoneModel {
        company_name: "YY Electronics".to_string(),
        model_name: "Super Phone 3000".to_string(),
        screen_size: 7.5,
        memory: 4_000_000,
        date_issued: 2020,
        on_sale: Cell::new(true),
    };

    // 10 years later, super_phone_3000 is not on sale anymore
    super_phone_3000.on_sale.set(false);
}
```

`Cell` works for all types, but works best for simple Copy types because it gives values, not references. `Cell` has a method called `get()` for example that only works on Copy types.

Another type you can use is `RefCell`.

### RefCell

A `RefCell` is another way to change values without needing to declare `mut`. It means "reference cell", and is like a `Cell` but uses references instead of copies.

We will create a `User` struct. So far you can see that it is similar to `Cell`:

```rust
use std::cell::RefCell;

#[derive(Debug)]
struct User {
    id: u32,
    year_registered: u32,
    username: String,
    active: RefCell<bool>,
    // Many other fields
}

fn main() {
    let user_1 = User {
        id: 1,
        year_registered: 2020,
        username: "User 1".to_string(),
        active: RefCell::new(true),
    };

    println!("{:?}", user_1.active);
}
```

This prints `RefCell { value: true }`.

There are many methods for `RefCell`. Two of them are `.borrow()` and `.borrow_mut()`. With these methods, you can do the same thing you do with `&` and `&mut`. The rules are the same:

- Many borrows is fine,
- one mutable borrow is fine,
- but mutable and immutable together is not fine.

So changing the value in a `RefCell` is very easy:

```rust
// ðŸš§
user_1.active.replace(false);
println!("{:?}", user_1.active);
```

And there are many other methods like `replace_with` that uses a closure:

```rust
// ðŸš§
let date = 2020;

user_1
    .active
    .replace_with(|_| if date < 2000 { true } else { false });
println!("{:?}", user_1.active);
```

But you have to be careful with a `RefCell`, because it checks borrows at runtime, not compilation time. Runtime means when the program is actually running (after compilation). So this will compile, even though it is wrong:

```rust
use std::cell::RefCell;

#[derive(Debug)]
struct User {
    id: u32,
    year_registered: u32,
    username: String,
    active: RefCell<bool>,
    // Many other fields
}

fn main() {
    let user_1 = User {
        id: 1,
        year_registered: 2020,
        username: "User 1".to_string(),
        active: RefCell::new(true),
    };

    let borrow_one = user_1.active.borrow_mut(); // first mutable borrow - okay
    let borrow_two = user_1.active.borrow_mut(); // second mutable borrow - not okay
}
```

But if you run it, it will immediately panic.

```text
thread 'main' panicked at 'already borrowed: BorrowMutError', C:\Users\mithr\.rustup\toolchains\stable-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc\lib/rustlib/src/rust\src\libcore\cell.rs:877:9
note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace
error: process didn't exit successfully: `target\debug\rust_book.exe` (exit code: 101)
```

`already borrowed: BorrowMutError` is the important part. So when you use a `RefCell`, it is good to compile **and** run to check.

### Mutex

`Mutex` is another way to change values without declaring `mut`. Mutex means `mutual exclusion`, which means "only one at a time". This is why a `Mutex` is safe, because it only lets one process change it at a time. To do this, it uses `.lock()`. `Lock` is like locking a door from the inside. You go into a room, lock the door, and now you can change things inside the room. Nobody else can come in and stop you, because you locked the door.

A `Mutex` is easier to understand through examples.

```rust
use std::sync::Mutex;

fn main() {
    let my_mutex = Mutex::new(5); // A new Mutex<i32>. We don't need to say mut
    let mut mutex_changer = my_mutex.lock().unwrap(); // mutex_changer is a MutexGuard
                                                     // It has to be mut because we will change it
                                                     // Now it has access to the Mutex
                                                     // Let's print my_mutex to see:

    println!("{:?}", my_mutex); // This prints "Mutex { data: <locked> }"
                                // So we can't access the data with my_mutex now,
                                // only with mutex_changer

    println!("{:?}", mutex_changer); // This prints 5. Let's change it to 6.

    *mutex_changer = 6; // mutex_changer is a MutexGuard<i32> so we use * to change the i32

    println!("{:?}", mutex_changer); // Now it says 6
}
```

But `mutex_changer` still has a lock after it is done. How do we stop it? A `Mutex` is unlocked when the `MutexGuard` goes out of scope. "Go out of scope" means the code block is finished. For example:

```rust
use std::sync::Mutex;

fn main() {
    let my_mutex = Mutex::new(5);
    {
        let mut mutex_changer = my_mutex.lock().unwrap();
        *mutex_changer = 6;
    } // mutex_changer goes out of scope - now it is gone. It is not locked anymore

    println!("{:?}", my_mutex); // Now it says: Mutex { data: 6 }
}
```

If you don't want to use a different `{}` code block, you can use `std::mem::drop(mutex_changer)`. `std::mem::drop` means "make this go out of scope".

```rust
use std::sync::Mutex;

fn main() {
    let my_mutex = Mutex::new(5);
    let mut mutex_changer = my_mutex.lock().unwrap();
    *mutex_changer = 6;
    std::mem::drop(mutex_changer); // drop mutex_changer - it is gone now
                                   // and my_mutex is unlocked

    println!("{:?}", my_mutex); // Now it says: Mutex { data: 6 }
}
```

You have to be careful with a `Mutex` because if another variable tries to `lock` it, it will wait:

```rust
use std::sync::Mutex;

fn main() {
    let my_mutex = Mutex::new(5);
    let mut mutex_changer = my_mutex.lock().unwrap(); // mutex_changer has the lock
    let mut other_mutex_changer = my_mutex.lock().unwrap(); // other_mutex_changer wants the lock
                                                            // the program is waiting
                                                            // and waiting
                                                            // and will wait forever.

    println!("This will never print...");
}
```

One other method is `try_lock()`. Then it will try once, and if it doesn't get the lock it will give up. Don't do `try_lock().unwrap()`, because it will panic if it doesn't work. `if let` or `match` is better:

```rust
use std::sync::Mutex;

fn main() {
    let my_mutex = Mutex::new(5);
    let mut mutex_changer = my_mutex.lock().unwrap();
    let mut other_mutex_changer = my_mutex.try_lock(); // try to get the lock

    if let Ok(value) = other_mutex_changer {
        println!("The MutexGuard has: {}", value)
    } else {
        println!("Didn't get the lock")
    }
}
```

Also, you don't need to make a variable to change the `Mutex`. You can just do this:

```rust
use std::sync::Mutex;

fn main() {
    let my_mutex = Mutex::new(5);

    *my_mutex.lock().unwrap() = 6;

    println!("{:?}", my_mutex);
}
```

`*my_mutex.lock().unwrap() = 6;` means "unlock my_mutex and make it 6". There is no variable that holds it so you don't need to call `std::mem::drop`. You can do it 100 times if you want - it doesn't matter:

```rust
use std::sync::Mutex;

fn main() {
    let my_mutex = Mutex::new(5);

    for _ in 0..100 {
        *my_mutex.lock().unwrap() += 1; // locks and unlocks 100 times
    }

    println!("{:?}", my_mutex);
}
```

### RwLock

`RwLock` means "read write lock". It is like a `Mutex` but also like a `RefCell`. You use `.write().unwrap()` instead of `.lock().unwrap()` to change it. But you can also use `.read().unwrap()` to get read access. It is like `RefCell` because it follows the rules:

- many `.read()` variables is okay,
- one `.write()` variable is okay,
- but more than one `.write()` or `.read()` together with `.write()` is not okay.

The program will run forever if you try to `.write()` when you can't get access:

```rust
use std::sync::RwLock;

fn main() {
    let my_rwlock = RwLock::new(5);

    let read1 = my_rwlock.read().unwrap(); // one .read() is fine
    let read2 = my_rwlock.read().unwrap(); // two .read()s is also fine

    println!("{:?}, {:?}", read1, read2);

    let write1 = my_rwlock.write().unwrap(); // uh oh, now the program will wait forever
}
```

So we use `std::mem::drop`, just like in a `Mutex`.

```rust
use std::sync::RwLock;
use std::mem::drop; // We will use drop() many times

fn main() {
    let my_rwlock = RwLock::new(5);

    let read1 = my_rwlock.read().unwrap();
    let read2 = my_rwlock.read().unwrap();

    println!("{:?}, {:?}", read1, read2);

    drop(read1);
    drop(read2); // we dropped both, so we can use .write() now

    let mut write1 = my_rwlock.write().unwrap();
    *write1 = 6;
    drop(write1);
    println!("{:?}", my_rwlock);
}
```

And you can use `try_read()` and `try_write()` too.

```rust
use std::sync::RwLock;

fn main() {
    let my_rwlock = RwLock::new(5);

    let read1 = my_rwlock.read().unwrap();
    let read2 = my_rwlock.read().unwrap();

    if let Ok(mut number) = my_rwlock.try_write() {
        *number += 10;
        println!("Now the number is {}", number);
    } else {
        println!("Couldn't get write access, sorry!")
    };
}
```
