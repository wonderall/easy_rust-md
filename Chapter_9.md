## Printing 'hello, world!'
**See this chapter on YouTube: [Video 1](https://youtu.be/yYlPHRl2geQ), [Video 2](https://youtu.be/DTCSfBJJZb8)**

When you start a new Rust program, it always has this code:

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```

- `fn` means function,
- `main` is the function that starts the program,
- `()` means that we didn't give the function any variables to start.

`{}` is called a **code block**. This is the space where code lives.

`println!` is a **macro** that prints to the console. A **macro** is like a function that writes code for you. Macros have a `!` after them. We will learn about making macros later. For now, remember that `!` means that it is a macro.

To learn about the `;`, we will create another function. First, in `main` we will print a number 8:

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world number {}!", 8);
}
```

The `{}` in `println!` means "put the variable inside here". This prints `Hello, world number 8!`.


We can put more in, just like we did before:

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, worlds number {} and {}!", 8, 9);
}
```

This prints `Hello, worlds number 8 and 9!`.

Now let's create the function.

```rust
fn number() -> i32 {
    8
}

fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world number {}!", number());
}
```

This also prints `Hello, world number 8!`. When Rust looks at `number()` it sees a function. This function:

- Does not take anything (because it has `()`)
- Returns an `i32`. The `->` (called a "skinny arrow") shows what the function returns.

Inside the function is just `8`. Because there is no `;`, this is the value it returns. If it had a `;`, it would not return anything (it would return a `()`). Rust will not compile this if it has a `;`, because the return is `i32` and `;` returns `()`, not `i32`:

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world number {}", number());
}

fn number() -> i32 {
    8;  // ⚠️
}
```

```text
5 | fn number() -> i32 {
  |    ------      ^^^ expected `i32`, found `()`
  |    |
  |    implicitly returns `()` as its body has no tail or `return` expression
6 |     8;
  |      - help: consider removing this semicolon
```

This means "you told me that `number()` returns an `i32`, but you added a `;` so it doesn't return anything". So the compiler suggests removing the semicolon.

You can also write `return 8;` but in Rust it is normal to just remove the `;` to `return`.

When you want to give variables to a function, put them inside the `()`. You have to give them a name and write the type.

```rust
fn multiply(number_one: i32, number_two: i32) { // Two i32s will enter the function. We will call them number_one and number_two.
    let result = number_one * number_two;
    println!("{} times {} is {}", number_one, number_two, result);
}

fn main() {
    multiply(8, 9); // We can give the numbers directly
    let some_number = 10; // Or we can declare two variables
    let some_other_number = 2;
    multiply(some_number, some_other_number); // and put them in the function
}
```

We can also return an `i32`. Just take out the semicolon at the end:

```rust
fn multiply(number_one: i32, number_two: i32) -> i32 {
    let result = number_one * number_two;
    println!("{} times {} is {}", number_one, number_two, result);
    result // this is the i32 that we return
}

fn main() {
    let multiply_result = multiply(8, 9); // We used multiply() to print and to give the result to multiply_result
}
```

### Declaring variables and code blocks

Use `let` to declare a variable (declare a variable = tell Rust to make a variable).

```rust
fn main() {
    let my_number = 8;
    println!("Hello, number {}", my_number);
}
```

Variables start and end inside a code block `{}`. In this example, `my_number` ends before we call `println!`, because it is inside its own code block.

```rust
fn main() {
    {
        let my_number = 8; // my_number starts here
                           // my_number ends here!
    }

    println!("Hello, number {}", my_number); // ⚠️ there is no my_number and
                                             // println!() can't find it
}
```

You can use a code block to return a value:

```rust
fn main() {
    let my_number = {
        let second_number = 8;
        second_number + 9 // No semicolon, so the code block returns 8 + 9.
                          // It works just like a function
    };

    println!("My number is: {}", my_number);
}
```

If you add a semicolon inside the block, it will return `()` (nothing):

```rust
fn main() {
    let my_number = {
        let second_number = 8; // declare second_number,
        second_number + 9; // add 9 to second_number
                           // but we didn't return it!
                           // second_number dies now
    };

    println!("My number is: {:?}", my_number); // my_number is ()
}
```

So why did we write `{:?}` and not `{}`? We will talk about that now.
