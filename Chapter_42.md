## Cow

Cow is a very convenient enum. It means "clone on write" and lets you return a `&str` if you don't need a `String`, and a `String` if you need it. (It can also do the same with arrays vs. Vecs, etc.)

To understand it, let's look at the signature. It says:

```rust
pub enum Cow<'a, B>
where
    B: 'a + ToOwned + ?Sized,
 {
    Borrowed(&'a B),
    Owned(<B as ToOwned>::Owned),
}

fn main() {}
```

You know right away that `'a` means it works with references. The `ToOwned` trait means that it is a type that can be turned into an owned type. For example, `str` is usually a reference (`&str`) and you can turn it into an owned `String`.

Next is `?Sized`. This means "maybe Sized, but maybe not". Almost every type in Rust is Sized, but types like `str` are not. That is why we need a `&` for a `str`, because the compiler doesn't know the size. So if you want a trait that can use something like a `str`, you add `?Sized.`

Next are the `enum` variants. They are `Borrowed` and `Owned`.

Imagine that you have a function that returns `Cow<'static, str>`. If you tell the function to return `"My message".into()`, it will look at the type: "My message" is a `str`. This is a `Borrowed` type, so it chooses `Borrowed(&'a B)`. So it becomes `Cow::Borrowed(&'static str)`.

And if you give it a `format!("{}", "My message").into()` then it will look at the type. This time it is a `String`, because `format!` makes a `String`. So this time it will select "Owned".

Here is an example to test `Cow`. We will put a number into a function that returns a `Cow<'static, str>`. Depending on the number, it will create a `&str` or a `String`. Then it uses `.into()` to turn it into a `Cow`. When you do that, it will choose either `Cow::Borrowed` or `Cow::Owned`. Then we will match to see which one it chose.

```rust
use std::borrow::Cow;

fn modulo_3(input: u8) -> Cow<'static, str> {
    match input % 3 {
        0 => "Remainder is 0".into(),
        1 => "Remainder is 1".into(),
        remainder => format!("Remainder is {}", remainder).into(),
    }
}

fn main() {
    for number in 1..=6 {
        match modulo_3(number) {
            Cow::Borrowed(message) => println!("{} went in. The Cow is borrowed with this message: {}", number, message),
            Cow::Owned(message) => println!("{} went in. The Cow is owned with this message: {}", number, message),
        }
    }
}
```

This prints:

```text
1 went in. The Cow is borrowed with this message: Remainder is 1
2 went in. The Cow is owned with this message: Remainder is 2
3 went in. The Cow is borrowed with this message: Remainder is 0
4 went in. The Cow is borrowed with this message: Remainder is 1
5 went in. The Cow is owned with this message: Remainder is 2
6 went in. The Cow is borrowed with this message: Remainder is 0
```

`Cow` has some other methods like `into_owned` or `into_borrowed` so you can change it if you need to.
