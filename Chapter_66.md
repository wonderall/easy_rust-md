## The end?

This is the end of Rust in Easy English. But I am still here, and you can let me know if you have any questions. Feel free to [contact me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/mithridates) or add a pull request, issue, etc. You can also tell me if some parts weren't easy to understand. Rust in Easy English needs to be very easy to understand, so please let me know where the English is too difficult. Of course, Rust itself can be difficult to understand, but we can at least make sure that the English is easy.
